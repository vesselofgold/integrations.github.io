## Welcome to the Justice and Public Safety Sector Integration Delivery Service Portal!
The JPSS Information Services Branch (ISB) has identified the need to update its outdated integration technology and associated services. The current technology and services are not meeting the needs of the sector clients, because they are challenging to maintain and are being discontinued by suppliers. 

### Designing integration solutions is a complex task. 

Delivery of integration services is complex and requires a tailored approach to meet sector needs. There is no one-size-fits-all model of integration that is appropriate for all organizations and communities. 
There are many conflicting drivers and even more possible 'right' solutions. Unfortunately, there is no "cookbook" for enterprise integration solutions. The integration delivery service framework being developed as part of this modernization project will provide methodologies and best practices.

- Overall vision is to design and deliver solutions that are forward-thinking, adaptable, and scalable by supporting common components, interoperability, and ecosystem approaches. All hosted on stable and robust infrastructures.

### Our current pain points

* Licensing, infrastructure, and upgrades are expensive
* Business logic fragmented and exists outside applications; Integration coupled directly to data sources are inflexible
* Hard to find staff resources with capabilities
* Outdated technology
* Data models in the database are linked directly to API’s making it expensive to revise either one
* Lack of clarity around what integrations exist and who is accountable
* Lack of defined integration services and an easy way for clients to access integration services
* Lost opportunity to leverage what may already exist for new products
* Lack of Application Programming Interface (API) management repository/catalogue & processes
* Poor vendor-developer experience (i.e., not easy to find who to work with inside ISB and for what)
